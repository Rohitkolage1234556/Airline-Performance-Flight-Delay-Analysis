# Airline Performance & Flight Delay Prediction Dashboard

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes airline operations and predicts flight delays using historical flight data. It combines **data analysis, machine learning, and visualization** to provide actionable insights for airlines, airports, and passengers. Users can explore **flight performance KPIs** and predict **flight delays** with expected minutes using an interactive web app.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict whether a flight is likely to be delayed (Yes/No).  
- Estimate the expected delay in minutes if a delay occurs.  
- Analyze airline and airport performance using key metrics such as total flights, cancellation rate, delay causes, and average delay.  
- Provide an interactive dashboard for data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📊 Features
- **Multi-Task Machine Learning Model**:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Predicts if a flight will be delayed.  
  - **Random Forest Regressor**: Estimates average delay minutes for delayed flights.  
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Calculated KPIs: `delay_ratio`, `cancel_ratio`, `divert_ratio`, `avg_delay_per_flight`  
  - Encoded categorical features: `carrier_name`, `airport_name`  
- **Interactive Gradio Web App**: Input flight details to get real-time predictions.  
- **Power BI Dashboard**:
  - KPI Cards: Total Flights, % Delayed Flights, Avg Delay Minutes, % Cancelled  
  - Visualizations: Monthly delay trends, delays by carrier, airport-wise delay analysis, delay cause breakdown  
  - Filters/Slicers for Year, Month, Carrier, and Airport
